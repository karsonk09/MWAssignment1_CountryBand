<p>Welcome to the Boots 'N Beer Band official website, home to Iowa's favorite 
small-town band! See the different links on this page to get any cool novelty items, 
find out about important dates and events, or just to listen to what kind of music the band has been brewing up!</p>

<p>Need a band for your barn-yard wedding? Feel like listening to something that represents Iowa? 
Just wanna get out of the house and listen to a great small-town band? If so, then Boots 'N Beer 
Band is the band for you! They range from country to old rock to even old blues! There's nothing 
this band can't do!</p>

<p> The four band members: Joe, Randy, Denver and Jake, have been writing original songs for the past three years. 
The songs tell of the past in different ways. Most of the men spend their childhoods growning up in the midwest, Iowa is very dear to their hearts.
Simpson College was the meeting place and the rest is history.</p>

<p>Each band member can play a variety of instruments and have top notch vocals. If you are in search of a barn-yard
hoe-down, join us at one of our participating venues and purchase your tickets today!</p>
